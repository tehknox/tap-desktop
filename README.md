<h3>A Fork of The Airline Project</h3>
As of November 25th, 2015, I forked TAP-Desktop. Trying to implement new thing and fix the current problems from the game.
<hr/>
<h3>The Airline Project - freshly converted to git!</h3>
<p>Please consider donating to support The Airline Project! The game is and will continue to be free, however donations help cover expenses like domain name registration and web hosting</p>
<p>Down the road, we would love to add a dedicated deployment server, but these aren't cheap!</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3><i>System Requirements</i></h3>
For Development: Quad Core 3.0GHz, 6+GB RAM
For Testing: Dual Core 2.0GHz, 2+GB RAM

.NET Framework 4.5
Windows Vista/7/8
Visual Studio (2012)

<h3>Available Resources</h3>
The <a href="http://theairlineproject.com/forum">forum</a> is a great resource whether you are a casual user, contributor/beta tester, or core developer. It is the home base for many of the discussions surrounding playing and contributing to the game.

The wiki (see links at http://theairlineproject.com) is largely incomplete, although varying degrees of work have been done to create a searchable database of airlines, aircraft, and airports. Wiki contributors are always needed!

<b>Physical Resources</b>

We (well, Mike anyway) currently have server resources available for web and Linux related development. For more information, contact Mike on the forum.

<h3>I. Developing</h3>
If you are developing new features, please do a fork and pull request. Pull requests should generally be made on the current in-development branch nnn-dev.
For example, if you wanted to add dancing gnomes for 0.3.9, you would do a pull request on 039-dev.

If you are submitting a hotfix or patch, please do a fork and pull request for the nnn-patch branch. 

<h3>II. Contributing</h3>
If you are contributing airport, airline, or any other data from the XML data repository, please fork & pull request the dev branch. Fixes, improvements, and additions
will all be managed within this branch and pushed to master for releases. 

<h3>III. Issues</h3>
If you are simply reporting a bug, please use the issues section here on GitHub. Please indicate the commit or release version you are encountering the bug on, as well as any log files or steps to reproduce it. 
Requests for new features, tweaks, updates, etc should also be managed through GitHub issues.
